# Catalog
Web app using react + nodeJS + mysql to manage albums in a Catalog.

This Webapp runs in localhost

MySQL configurations are:
 host: 'localhost',
 port: 3306,
 user: 'admin',
 password: 'admin',
 database: 'Catalog'

If you want customized configurations, you should edit it in server/db/connection.js.
Script with database tables is in server/create_database.mysql, but don't worry, if you don't want to create it, when jondeJS starts, it will be created.
